## Open Source Data Tools
- [Knime](https://www.knime.com/): KNIME Analytics Platform is the leading open solution for data-driven innovation, helping you discover the potential hidden in your data, mine for fresh insights, or predict new futures. With more than 1000 modules, hundreds of ready-to-run examples, a comprehensive range of integrated tools, and the widest choice of advanced algorithms available, KNIME Analytics Platform is the perfect toolbox for any data scientist.

- [R Programming](https://www.r-project.org/): What if I tell you that Project R, a GNU project, is written in R itself? It’s primarily written in C and Fortran. And a lot of its modules are written in R itself. It’s a free software programming language and software environment for statistical computing and graphics. The R language is widely used among data miners for developing statistical software and data analysis. Ease of use and extensibility has raised R’s popularity substantially in recent years. Besides data mining, it provides statistical and graphical techniques, including linear and nonlinear modeling, classical statistical tests, time-series analysis, classification, clustering, and others.

- [Orange](https://orange.biolab.si/): Orange is open source data visualization and data analysis for novice and expert and provides interactive workflows with a large toolbox to create interactive workflows to analyze and visualize data. Orange is packed with different visualizations, from scatter plots, bar charts, trees, to dendrograms, networks and heat maps.

- [Pentaho](http://www.pentaho.com/): Pentaho addresses the barriers that block your organization's ability to get value from all your data. The platform simplifies preparing and blending any data and includes a spectrum of tools to easily analyze, visualize, explore, report and predict.

- [Weka](https://weka.wikispaces.com/): Weka, an open source software, is a collection of machine learning algorithms for data mining tasks. The algorithms can either be applied directly to a data set or called from your own JAVA code. It is also well suited for developing new machine learning schemes, since it was fully implemented in the JAVA programming language, plus supporting several standard data mining tasks. For someone who hasn’t coded for a while, Weka with its GUI provides the easiest transition into the world of Data Science. Being written in Java, those with Java experience can call the library into their code as well.

- [NodeXL](http://nodexl.codeplex.com/): NodeXL is a data visualization and analysis software of relationships and networks. NodeXL provides exact calculations. It is a free (not the pro one) and open-source network analysis and visualization software. It is one of the best statistical tools for data analysis which includes advanced network metrics, access to social media network data importers, and automation.

- [Gephi](https://gephi.org/): Gephi is also an open-source network analysis and visualization software package written in Java on the NetBeans platform. Think of the giant friendship maps you see that represent LinkedIn or Facebook connections. Gephi takes that a step further by providing exact calculations.

## Data Visualization Tools
- [Datawrapper](https://www.datawrapper.de/): Datawrapper is an online data-visualization tool for making interactive charts. Once you upload the data from CSV/PDF/Excel file or paste it directly into the field, Datawrapper will generate a bar, line, map or any other related visualization. Datawrapper graphs can be embedded into any website or CMS with ready-to-use embed codes. So many reporters and news organizations use Datawrapper to embed live charts into their articles. It is very easy to use and produces effective graphics.

- [Solver](http://www.solverglobal.com/): Solver specializes in providing world-class financial reporting, budgeting, and analysis with push-button access to all data sources that drive company-wide profitability. Solver provides BI360, which is available for cloud and on-premise deployment, focusing on four key analytics areas.

- [Qlik](http://www.qlik.com/us/): Qlik lets you create visualizations, dashboards, and apps that answer your company’s most important questions. Now you can see the whole story that lives within your data.

- [Tableau](https://www.tableau.com/): Tableau democratizes visualization in an elegantly simple and intuitive tool. It is exceptionally powerful in business because it communicates insights through data visualization. In the analytics process, Tableau's visuals allow you to quickly investigate a hypothesis, sanity checks your gut, and just go explore the data before embarking on a treacherous statistical journey.

- [Power BI](https://www.powerbi.com):

- [Google Fusion Tables](https://support.google.com/fusiontables/answer/2571232): Fusion Tables meet Google Spreadsheets cooler, larger, and much nerdier cousin. Google Fusion Tables is an incredible tool for data analysis, large data-set visualization, and mapping. Not surprisingly, Google's incredible mapping software plays a big role in pushing this tool onto the list. Take for instance this map, which I made to look at oil production platforms in the Gulf of Mexico.

- [Infogram](https://infogram.com/): Infogram offers over 35 interactive charts and more than 500 maps to help you visualize your data beautifully. Create a variety of charts including column, bar, pie, or word cloud. You can even add a map to your infographic or report to really impress your audience.

## Sentiment Tools
- [Opentext](http://www.opentext.com/): The OpenText Sentiment Analysis module is a specialized classification engine used to identify and evaluate subjective patterns and expressions of sentiment within textual content. The analysis is performed at the topic, sentence, and document level and is configured to recognize whether portions of text are factual or subjective and, in the latter case, if the opinion expressed within these pieces of content is positive, negative, mixed, or neutral.

- [Semantria](https://www.lexalytics.com/): Semantria is a tool that offers a unique service approach by gathering texts, tweets, and other comments from clients and analyzing them meticulously to derive actionable and highly valuable insights. Semantria offers text analysis via API and Excel plugin. It differs from Lexalytics in that it is offered via API and Excel plugin, and in that it incorporates a bigger knowledge base and uses deep learning.

- [Trackur](http://www.trackur.com/): Trackur’s automated sentiment analysis looks at the specific keyword you are monitoring and then determines if the sentiment towards that keyword is positive, negative or neutral with the document. That’s weighted the most in Trackur algorithm. It could use to monitor all social media and mainstream news, to gain executive insights through trends, keyword discovery, automated sentiment analysis and influence scoring.

- [SAS Sentiment Analysis](https://www.sas.com/en_us/software/sentiment-analysis.html): SAS sentiment analysis automatically extracts sentiments in real time or over a period of time with a unique combination of statistical modeling and rule-based natural language processing techniques. Built-in reports show patterns and detailed reactions. So you can hone in on the sentiments that are expressed. 
With ongoing evaluations, you can refine models and adjust classifications to reflect emerging topics and new terms relevant to your customers, organization or industry.

- [Opinion Crawl](http://opinioncrawl.net/): Opinion Crawl is an online sentiment analysis for current events, companies, products, and people. Opinion Crawl allows visitors to assess Web sentiment on a topic - a person, an event, a company or a product. You can enter a topic and get an ad-hoc sentiment assessment of it. For each topic, you get a pie chart showing current real-time sentiment, a list of the latest news headlines, a few thumbnail images, and a tag cloud of key semantic concepts that the public associates with the subject. The concepts allow you to see what issues or events drive the sentiment in a positive or negative way. For more in-depth assessment, the web crawlers would find the latest published content on many popular subjects and current public issues and calculate sentiment for them on an ongoing basis. Then the blog posts would show the trend of sentiment over time, as well as the Positive-to-Negative ratio.
